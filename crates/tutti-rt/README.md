# tutti-rt

Small data structures that are safe to touch from an audio callback, where code must not wait, allocate or take locks.

It depends only on arc-lend, not on the rest of tutti, so it can be used on its own. It is mostly a building block for the other tutti crates.

This crate is part of [tutti](https://github.com/PoHsuanLai/tutti), a real-time audio engine for Rust.
